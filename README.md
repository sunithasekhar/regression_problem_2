## regression_problem_2 ##

The lifespan of an organism is predicted from the given data from three sensors. The dataset contains three feature columns, and the fourth column being the target value.
In this case, the model is not linear. Several non-linear regression
models are tried on the train split and the following metrics are reported on the test split **(a) Mean Squared Error**, **(b)
Mean Absolute Error**. 
Models used are **Suppot Vector Regression**, and **Linear Regression**. Later the **Random Forest model** and the **Gradient boosting models** are used for fitting the data.
